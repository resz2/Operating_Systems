## Compiling of Linux Kernel
1. You have to download the latest kernel from kernel.org
2. You will compile it using instructions available online (various sources are available and your should be able to find on your own).
3. Option to log into your kernel should be available in the boot loader i.e. when your computer boots, one should see a menu and option to log into your kernel. This is similar to what you get when you make your machine dual-boot.
4. Please do all the task inside a virtual machine so that any wrong operation does not affect your actual operating system.

Once you have done the above tasks, you will have to make a document that you will submit here. The document will consists of 
1. Kernel version
2. Steps that you followed from beginning till the end in doing task 2-3.
