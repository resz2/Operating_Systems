## Compiling of Linux Kernel
To do:

1. You have to download the latest kernel from `kernel.org`
2. You will compile it using instructions available online (various sources are available and your should be able to find on your own).
3. Option to log into your kernel should be available in the boot loader i.e. when your computer boots, one should see a menu and option to log into your kernel. This is similar to what you get when you make your machine dual-boot.
4. Please do all the task inside a virtual machine so that any wrong operation does not affect your actual operating system.
